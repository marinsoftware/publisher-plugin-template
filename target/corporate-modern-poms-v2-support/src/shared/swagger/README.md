The template files in this folder are follow Swagger spec 1.2.

NOTE: Marin had to manually copy the contents of file markdown.mustache into strapdown.html.mustache because the 
mustache include functionality doesn't work when run within maven.  If you decided to upgrade the swagger maven
plugin to a newer verion and encounter the same problem, then you may also have to manually merge the templates.
